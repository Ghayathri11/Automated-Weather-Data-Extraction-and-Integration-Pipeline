This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive project that automates the process of extracting weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and seamlessly integrates it into a Snowflake database. The project comprises the following key components:

Data Extraction: It includes Python scripts for fetching real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This data includes vital information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

Data Transformation: The extracted data is processed and prepared for storage and integration using Lambda functions and AWS services. This step ensures that the data is in the desired format and quality.

Data Storage: The processed data is securely stored in an Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket. S3 provides a reliable and scalable storage solution for the collected weather data.

Integration with Snowflake: A Snowpipe integration is established to automatically load the weather data from the S3 bucket into a Snowflake data warehouse. Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform known for its performance and scalability.

Automation: The project emphasizes automation throughout the entire pipeline, reducing manual intervention and ensuring timely and accurate data updates.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in automating the extraction, transformation, and integration of weather data into a Snowflake database, providing a reliable and up-to-date source of weather information for analysis and reporting.
